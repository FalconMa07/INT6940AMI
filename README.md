# INT6940AMI

Scope of Work:

1. Review SKEPSIS work to evaluate if it is possible to use PDF templates that can be parsed for data elements to automatically compute when a PDF is uploaded.
2. Use any publicly available data (e.g.: CDI) to evaluate CV risk related data patterns based on data Framingham and Hellenic (and metabolic syndrome) to provide prescriptive recommendations for potential patterns to watch (e.g.: If you are X and have Y, then, you could also get Z).
3. The project is open enough for the students to use AI/ML to come up with prescriptive recommendations within the scope of CV risk parameters (HDL/LDL, Diabetes, Smoking, Obesity indicators, etc.)

Additional Consideration: There is also a related project where another team is working on UX/Website project incorporating a new metabolic syndrome as part of the Cardiovascular risk. So, I suggest you also have cross-team collaboration with that team to avoid having the sponsor repeat information.
